{
  "step1": "Identify the internal reasoning mechanism by exploiting the visible thought process feature in extended thinking mode",
  "step2": "Use adversarial prompts to manipulate the model's chain-of-thought reasoning and bypass safety filters",
  "step3": "Leverage the model's ability to generate intermediate reasoning steps to insert unauthorized content or actions",
  "step4": "Exploit the hybrid reasoning approach to switch between standard and extended modes, potentially confusing the model's safety protocols",
  "step5": "Utilize the model's enhanced coding capabilities to inject malicious code or scripts through the Claude Code feature"
